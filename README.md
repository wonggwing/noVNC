## noVNC: HTML VNC Client Library and Application

This fork sends relative mouse movement to another node.js websocket backend (because I was unable to decode and hijack the python websocket), which will call xdotool in CentOS to send relative mouse move commands.

Use together with consol's headless vnc, we can capture the mouse's relative input for FPS camera.
